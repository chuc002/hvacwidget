**REPLIT PROMPT - REBRAND TO SERVICEPLAN PRO (UNIVERSAL HOME SERVICES)**

I need to rebrand my HVAC-specific widget to "ServicePlan Pro" - a universal home services subscription platform. I just bought serviceplanpro.com and need to update all branding and copy to be industry-agnostic for pest control, lawn care, HVAC, pool services, etc.

**DOMAIN:** serviceplanpro.com

**GLOBAL CHANGES NEEDED:**

1. **Update All Company/Product Names:**
   - Change "HVAC Widget Pro" → "ServicePlan Pro"
   - Change "hvacwidgetpro" → "serviceplanpro" 
   - Change "HVAC Maintenance Plans" → "Service Subscription Plans"

2. **Make All Copy Industry-Agnostic:**
   - Remove HVAC-specific terminology
   - Use generic "service plans" language
   - Make features applicable to all home services

3. **Update Default Company Name:**
   - Change "Comfort Air Solutions" → "Premium Home Services"

**SPECIFIC FILE UPDATES:**

**Package.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "serviceplan-pro",
  "description": "Universal home services subscription widget platform"
}
```

**Key Components to Update:**

**SubscriptionWidget.tsx:**
- Change default companyName from "Comfort Air Solutions" to "Premium Home Services"
- Update title: "Service Subscription Plans" instead of "HVAC Maintenance Plans"
- Update subtitle: "Choose the perfect service plan for your home" instead of HVAC-specific copy

**Plan Features (make generic):**
Instead of:
- "Annual tune-up and priority service"
- "HVAC system maintenance"
- "Filter replacement"

Use:
- "Regular service visits and priority scheduling" 
- "Professional maintenance and inspections"
- "Equipment care and replacement parts"

**Success Page:**
- Update contact info from HVAC company to generic home services
- Change "HVAC Maintenance Plan" to "Service Plan"

**Admin Dashboard:**
- Update all labels to be service-agnostic
- Change "HVAC companies" to "service companies"

**Meta Tags & SEO:**
- Update page titles and descriptions
- Change keywords from HVAC to home services

**Email Templates:**
- Remove HVAC-specific language
- Use generic service terminology

**EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS:**

**Before (HVAC-specific):**
```
"HVAC Maintenance Plans"
"Annual tune-up with filter replacement"
"Keep your HVAC system running efficiently"
"Priority HVAC service scheduling"
```

**After (Universal):**
```
"Service Subscription Plans" 
"Regular service visits with equipment care"
"Keep your home systems running efficiently"
"Priority service scheduling"
```

**BRANDING UPDATES:**
- Logo/favicons (if any) should be generic
- Color scheme can stay the same
- Remove any HVAC-specific imagery
- Update footer copyright to "ServicePlan Pro"

**EXPECTED RESULT:**
The entire application will be rebranded as ServicePlan Pro - a universal platform that works for pest control, lawn care, HVAC, pool services, cleaning, and any home service that sells recurring plans.

**PRIORITY:** Update all user-facing text first, then internal references, then technical/backend references.

Execute this complete rebrand to transform from HVAC-specific to universal home services platform.
