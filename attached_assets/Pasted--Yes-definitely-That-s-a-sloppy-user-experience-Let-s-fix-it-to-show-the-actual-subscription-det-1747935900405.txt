## REPLIT PROMPT - FIX SUCCESS PAGE SUBSCRIPTION DETAILS

My success page currently shows "Subscription details could not be loaded" but I want to display the actual subscription information to create a better customer experience.

**CURRENT ISSUE:** 
The success page has a placeholder message instead of real subscription details.

**WHAT I NEED:**

1. **Extract session_id from URL parameters** on the success page
2. **Call Stripe API to retrieve session details** using the session_id
3. **Display actual subscription information:**
   - Plan name (Basic/Premium/Ultimate)
   - Price paid ($149.99/$249.99/$349.99)
   - Billing frequency (yearly)
   - Customer email
   - Subscription start date

**IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:**

1. **Create API endpoint** `/api/get-session-details` that:
   - Takes session_id as parameter
   - Calls Stripe to get checkout session details
   - Returns formatted subscription data

2. **Update success page** to:
   - Extract session_id from URL query params
   - Call the API endpoint to get session details
   - Display the subscription information instead of error message
   - Handle loading states properly

3. **Replace the yellow warning box** with a clean subscription summary card showing:
   - ✅ Plan: Premium HVAC Maintenance Plan
   - ✅ Amount: $249.99/year
   - ✅ Email: customer@example.com
   - ✅ Start Date: [current date]

**EXPECTED RESULT:** 
Customers see their actual subscription details instead of "could not be loaded" message, creating a much more professional experience.

Fix the success page to show real subscription details using the Stripe session data.
