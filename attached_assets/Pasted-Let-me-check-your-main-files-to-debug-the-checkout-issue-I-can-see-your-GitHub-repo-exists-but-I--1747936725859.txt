Let me check your main files to debug the checkout issue:

I can see your GitHub repo exists, but I'm having trouble accessing the specific code files. Let me try a different approach:

I can't access your specific GitHub files directly, but based on your description of getting a blank screen, let me give you a targeted debugging approach:

## Most Likely Issue: Frontend-Backend Communication

**The blank screen suggests the frontend isn't properly calling your API or handling the response.**

## REPLIT PROMPT - DEBUG BLANK SCREEN ON CHECKOUT

My HVAC widget shows a blank screen when customers try to checkout. The Stripe integration was working before but now customers get a blank screen after clicking "Continue to Payment".

**DEBUGGING STEPS NEEDED:**

1. **Check frontend API call in SubscriptionWidget component:**
   - Verify the fetch call to `/api/create-checkout-session` is working
   - Add console.log statements to track the request/response
   - Ensure proper error handling for failed API calls

2. **Verify API endpoint is responding:**
   - Test that `/api/create-checkout-session` endpoint exists and works
   - Check that it's properly imported in the main server file
   - Ensure it returns the correct JSON response with Stripe URL

3. **Check for JavaScript errors:**
   - Look for any runtime errors preventing the redirect to Stripe
   - Verify all imports and dependencies are working
   - Check for any TypeScript compilation errors

4. **Test the redirect logic:**
   - Ensure `window.location.href = data.url` is executing
   - Add logging before and after the redirect attempt
   - Check if the Stripe URL is being returned correctly

**SPECIFIC DEBUGGING CODE TO ADD:**

```javascript
// In your subscription handler function
console.log('Starting checkout process...');
const response = await fetch('/api/create-checkout-session', { /* your config */ });
console.log('API Response status:', response.status);
const data = await response.json();
console.log('API Response data:', data);

if (data.url) {
  console.log('Redirecting to:', data.url);
  window.location.href = data.url;
} else {
  console.error('No URL returned from API');
}
```

**EXPECTED RESULT:** 
Customers should be redirected to Stripe checkout instead of seeing a blank screen.

Debug and fix the checkout flow so the Stripe redirect works properly.
