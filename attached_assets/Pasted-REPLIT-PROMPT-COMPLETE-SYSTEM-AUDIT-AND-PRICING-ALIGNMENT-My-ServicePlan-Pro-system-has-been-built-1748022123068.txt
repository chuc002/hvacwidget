REPLIT PROMPT - COMPLETE SYSTEM AUDIT AND PRICING ALIGNMENT
My ServicePlan Pro system has been built over time with multiple iterations. I need a comprehensive audit to verify everything works consistently and pricing is aligned across all pages.

PRICING CONSISTENCY AUDIT:

1. FIND ALL PRICING REFERENCES:
Search entire codebase for:
- Any mention of "$200", "$299", "$399", "$499", "$699", "$999"
- Files to check: Pricing.tsx, constants.ts, saas-plans.ts, widget pricing
- Stripe Price IDs that might reference old pricing
- Database schemas with pricing data

2. STANDARDIZE B2B SAAS PRICING:
CORRECT PRICING STRUCTURE:
- Starter: $399/month (subscriptions only)
- Professional: $699/month (+ products, custom branding)  
- Enterprise: $999/month (+ invoices, multi-location, API)

UPDATE ALL INSTANCES:
- pages/Pricing.tsx
- lib/saas-plans.ts
- Any constants files
- Marketing copy throughout site
- Stripe product catalog
- Customer dashboard displays

3. VERIFY STRIPE CONFIGURATION:
CHECK STRIPE DASHBOARD:
- Do I have 3 products at $399, $699, $999?
- Are Price IDs correctly mapped in code?
- Test mode vs Live mode consistency
- Webhook endpoints configured

4. COMPLETE FLOW TESTING:

TEST CUSTOMER ACQUISITION:
- Visit homepage → Navigate to pricing → Sign up for plan
- Does pricing match throughout journey?
- Does Stripe checkout show correct amount?
- Does customer dashboard show correct plan?

TEST WIDGET FUNCTIONALITY:
- Customer signs up → Gets dashboard → Generates embed code
- Test embed code on sample page
- Customer subscribes through widget
- Verify payment goes to correct account

TEST MONEY FLOWS:
Path A: HVAC Company pays ME for platform access
- Sign up → Choose plan → Pay $399-999/month → Get dashboard access

Path B: Homeowner pays HVAC Company through widget  
- Use embed widget → Subscribe to maintenance → Payment goes to HVAC company

5. NAVIGATION VERIFICATION:
TEST ALL LINKS:
- Public site navigation (Home, Features, Pricing, Demo, etc.)
- Customer portal navigation (Overview, Customize, Analytics, etc.)
- Mobile navigation
- Footer links
- CTA buttons throughout site

6. CONTENT COMPLETENESS CHECK:
VERIFY EVERY PAGE HAS REAL CONTENT:
- /how-it-works → Step-by-step process
- /features → Feature list with descriptions
- /pricing → Consistent B2B SaaS pricing
- /demo → Working widget demo
- /industries → Industry-specific content
- /case-studies → Customer success stories
- Dashboard tabs → Functional customer tools

7. STRIPE INTEGRATION AUDIT:
VERIFY CONFIGURATION:
- Public key: pk_test_ or pk_live_
- Secret key: sk_test_ or sk_live_  
- Webhook secret: whsec_
- Price IDs match code references
- Test payments work end-to-end

8. CUSTOMER ONBOARDING FLOW:
TEST COMPLETE JOURNEY:
- Registration → Payment → Welcome → Dashboard → Customize → Embed → Test
- Each step works without errors
- Professional appearance throughout
- Clear next steps at each stage

9. ADMIN/BUSINESS CONTROLS:
VERIFY I CAN:
- See all customers and their plans
- Track my SaaS revenue
- Manage customer subscriptions
- Access analytics and reporting
- Handle customer support

10. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS:
TEST ON MOBILE:
- All pages load correctly
- Navigation works on mobile
- Widget works on mobile devices
- Payment flows work on mobile

CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS:

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR PRICING:
Create lib/pricing-config.ts with:
```typescript
export const SaaSPlans = {
  starter: { price: 399, name: "Starter" },
  professional: { price: 699, name: "Professional" },
  enterprise: { price: 999, name: "Enterprise" }
};
