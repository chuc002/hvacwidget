REPLIT PROMPT - CREATE COMPLETE DUAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM
My ServicePlan Pro site has no proper navigation structure. I need a dual system: public marketing site for prospects + private customer portal for paying customers.

PROBLEM: 
- No way for prospects to navigate and learn about ServicePlan Pro
- No separation between marketing pages and customer dashboard
- Missing critical conversion pages (pricing, features, demo)
- Poor user experience for both prospects and customers

CREATE DUAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM:

1. PUBLIC SITE NAVIGATION (components/PublicNavigation.tsx):
TOP BAR:
- Logo: "ServicePlan Pro" 
- Nav Links: How It Works | Features | Pricing | Demo | Industries | Case Studies
- CTAs: "Login" (outline button) | "Start Free Trial" (primary button)

MOBILE RESPONSIVE:
- Hamburger menu for mobile
- Collapsible navigation
- Touch-friendly buttons

2. CUSTOMER PORTAL NAVIGATION (components/CustomerNavigation.tsx):
TOP BAR:
- Logo: "ServicePlan Pro" 
- Company Name: "Premium Home Services" (from customer data)
- User Menu: Settings | Support | Logout

SIDEBAR OR TABS:
- Overview (dashboard home)
- Customize Widget  
- Revenue Streams
- Customer Management
- Analytics
- Billing & Plan
- Support

3. ROUTING STRUCTURE (App.tsx):
PUBLIC ROUTES (no auth required):
- / → Landing page for HVAC companies
- /how-it-works → Process explanation
- /features → Widget capabilities  
- /pricing → B2B SaaS pricing
- /demo → Live widget demo
- /industries → Industry-specific pages
- /case-studies → Success stories
- /register → B2B signup
- /login → Customer login

PROTECTED ROUTES (auth required):
- /dashboard → Customer portal home
- /customize → Widget customization
- /analytics → Performance metrics
- /billing → Subscription management
- /customers → Their subscriber list
- /support → Help center

4. NAVIGATION LOGIC:
- If user NOT logged in → Show PublicNavigation
- If user IS logged in → Show CustomerNavigation  
- Automatic redirects based on auth state
- Clear login/logout flows

5. UPDATE EXISTING PAGES:
- Home.tsx → B2B landing page (target HVAC companies)
- Pricing.tsx → B2B SaaS plans with clear CTAs
- Add missing pages: HowItWorks.tsx, Features.tsx, Demo.tsx

6. AUTHENTICATION STATE MANAGEMENT:
- Login/logout functionality
- Protected route guards
- User session management
- Trial vs paid customer states

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Clean separation between marketing site and customer portal
- Easy navigation for prospects to learn and convert
- Professional customer dashboard experience
- Mobile-responsive throughout
- Clear conversion funnels from prospect to customer

MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Readable text sizes
- Proper spacing for mobile interaction
- Fast loading times

The site should feel like two distinct but connected experiences: a professional marketing site that converts prospects, and a powerful customer portal that retains and serves paying customers.
