REPLIT PROMPT - FIX B2B/B2C MESSAGING CONFUSION
I have a critical business model mismatch in my ServicePlan Pro platform. My landing page targets homeowners (B2C) but my pricing targets businesses (B2B). I need to align everything as a B2B SaaS platform that sells to HVAC companies, not homeowners.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Home.tsx talks to homeowners: "Subscribe to regular service to keep your home systems running"
- Pricing.tsx talks to businesses: "$399-999/month for home service businesses"
- This confuses both audiences and kills conversions

BUSINESS MODEL CLARIFICATION:
I am building a B2B SaaS platform where:
- TARGET CUSTOMERS: HVAC companies, pest control, lawn care businesses
- WHAT THEY PAY ME: $399-999/month to use my widget platform
- WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS GET: Ability to subscribe to maintenance plans online
- MY REVENUE: Monthly SaaS subscriptions from businesses

COMPLETE HOME.TX REWRITE NEEDED:
Transform from homeowner-focused to business-owner-focused:

WRONG (current):
- "Service Subscription Plans"
- "Subscribe to regular service to keep your home systems running"
- "Choose a Plan" (talking to homeowners)

RIGHT (needed):
- "Turn Your Website Visitors Into Recurring Subscribers"
- "Help your customers subscribe to your services online - no more manual processes"
- "Get More Maintenance Customers" (talking to business owners)

NEW HOME.TSX STRUCTURE NEEDED:

Hero Section:
- Headline: "Turn Your Home Service Business Into a Recurring Revenue Machine"
- Subheadline: "Professional subscription widgets that let customers sign up for your maintenance plans online 24/7"
- CTA: "Start Free Trial" and "Book Demo"

Problem Section:
- "Stop Losing Customers to Manual Processes"
- "70% of potential maintenance customers never sign up because they can't do it online"
- "Phone tag and manual processes are costing you revenue"

Solution Section:
- "Professional Subscription Widgets That Convert"
- "5-minute setup on your website"
- "Customers subscribe instantly with 3 clicks"
- "You get complete customer data automatically"

Social Proof Section:
- "Trusted by 500+ Home Service Businesses"
- Customer testimonials from HVAC company owners
- "Average customer sees 300% increase in subscriptions"

Competitive Section:
- "The Simple Alternative to Contractor Commerce"
- "Same results at 65% lower cost"
- "No contracts, no setup fees, no transaction fees"

Features Section:
- Custom branding to match your company
- Mobile-responsive for all devices
- Stripe payment processing
- Customer data collection
- Analytics dashboard

Industries Section:
- HVAC Services, Pest Control, Lawn Care, Pool Service
- "Works for any recurring home service"

Pricing CTA:
- "Choose Your Plan" → redirect to /pricing
- "See Live Demo" → redirect to /demo
- "Book Personal Demo" → redirect to /book-demo

ALSO UPDATE:
- Remove all homeowner language throughout the site
- Change "your home" to "your business" or "your customers"
- Update navigation to be business-focused
- Ensure consistent B2B messaging across all pages

TARGET AUDIENCE LANGUAGE:
- Speak to business owners, not homeowners
- Focus on business benefits: more customers, recurring revenue, automation
- Use business terminology: leads, conversion, ROI, efficiency
- Address business pain points: manual processes, lost opportunities, staff time

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING:
- Position against Contractor Commerce directly
- Emphasize simplicity over complexity
- Highlight cost savings and faster setup
- Show ROI and business growth benefits

EXPECTED RESULT:
A professional B2B SaaS landing page that speaks directly to HVAC company owners and positions ServicePlan Pro as the affordable, simple alternative to Contractor Commerce.

Fix the messaging confusion and align everything as a B2B platform targeting home service businesses, not homeowners.
