REPLIT PROMPT - OPTIMIZE SERVICEPLAN PRO FOR HIGH CONVERSIONS

My ServicePlan Pro production infrastructure is ready. Now I need to optimize conversion rates and ensure professional polish before launching to HVAC companies.

CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION FOCUS:

1. MOBILE UX VERIFICATION & POLISH:
- Test widget at 375px width and ensure no overflow
- Verify all buttons/touch targets are ≥44px minimum
- Ensure plan cards stack properly in single column on mobile
- Add proper hover states and elevation to plan cards (4dp shadow)
- Test complete mobile signup flow on actual device

2. CHECKOUT FLOW ENHANCEMENT:
- Add progress indicator: "Step 1 of 2" → "Step 2 of 2" 
- Show loading spinner/skeleton during Stripe session creation
- Disable payment buttons during processing to prevent double-clicks
- Add clear success/error messaging throughout flow
- Test and optimize checkout abandonment points

3. FORM UX IMPROVEMENTS:
- Implement real-time inline validation (as user types)
- Add phone number auto-formatting: (xxx) xxx-xxxx
- Auto-suggest city/state from ZIP code entry
- Prevent form submission until all fields are valid
- Clear, helpful error messages

4. FINAL MESSAGING AUDIT:
- Search codebase for any pricing inconsistencies (must be $399/$699/$999 everywhere)
- Remove any remaining B2C language ("for your home", "subscribe now")
- Ensure all CTAs target business owners ("Start Free Trial", "Get More Customers")
- Verify competitive positioning vs Contractor Commerce is clear

5. PROFESSIONAL POLISH:
- Test all navigation links work properly
- Ensure consistent styling across all pages
- Verify customer dashboard has all promised features
- Test complete customer journey: signup → customize → embed → test
- Check that embed codes generate correctly and work on external sites

6. CONVERSION RATE TESTING:
- Complete test signup as HVAC business owner
- Time the entire onboarding process (should be <10 minutes)
- Verify widget customization tools work intuitively
- Test mobile and desktop conversion flows
- Ensure pricing comparison vs Contractor Commerce is compelling

EXPECTED RESULT:
A conversion-optimized platform that:
- Converts 40%+ of mobile visitors (vs industry average 15%)
- Has <20% checkout abandonment (vs typical 40%)
- Looks more professional than Contractor Commerce
- Provides smooth 5-minute setup experience
- Justifies premium pricing with superior UX

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Mobile usability score >90%
- Form completion rate >80%
- Checkout conversion rate >60%
- Professional appearance that builds trust
- Clear competitive advantage over Contractor Commerce

This optimization should result in 3-5x higher conversion rates, making the difference between a struggling startup and a successful SaaS business.
