REPLIT PROMPT - VERIFY COMPLETE PAYMENT AND EMBED SYSTEM
I need to verify that all payment flows and core SaaS functionality work correctly before launching ServicePlan Pro to real customers.

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

1. SAAS SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS (Companies pay ME):
TEST FLOW:
- Go to /register 
- Sign up as business
- Should prompt for payment method (Stripe)
- Subscribe to Starter/Professional/Enterprise plan
- Payment should go to MY Stripe account
- Customer should get access to dashboard

VERIFY:
- Are SaaS plans configured in Stripe? ($399, $699, $999/month)
- Does registration flow collect payment?
- Do I see subscriptions in MY Stripe dashboard?
- Are webhooks updating customer status?

2. CUSTOMER WIDGET PAYMENTS (Homeowners pay HVAC companies):
TEST FLOW:
- Create test customer account
- Get embed code from their dashboard
- Visit embedded widget
- Subscribe to maintenance plan
- Payment should go to THEIR Stripe account (NOT mine)

VERIFY:
- Does embed system work?
- Can end customers complete purchases?
- Where do these payments go?
- Is Stripe Connect configured for multi-party payments?

3. EMBED CODE GENERATION:
VERIFY EXISTS:
- Customer dashboard has "Embed Code" section
- Generates unique URL: /embed/CUSTOMER_ID
- Provides iframe code
- Shows implementation instructions
- Has customization options

4. CUSTOMER ONBOARDING:
VERIFY COMPLETE FLOW:
- Registration → Payment → Dashboard → Customize → Embed → Test → Go Live
- Each step has clear instructions
- No broken links or missing pages
- Professional appearance throughout

5. MONEY FLOW VERIFICATION:
DOCUMENT EXACTLY:
- SaaS subscriptions: Companies pay ME monthly
- Widget transactions: End customers pay HVAC companies
- Transaction fees: Do I take a cut or flat SaaS fee?
- Stripe accounts: Do I need Stripe Connect for multi-party?

6. ADMIN CONTROLS:
VERIFY I CAN:
- See all customers and their plans
- Track subscription revenue
- Manage customer accounts
- Handle support requests
- Monitor system usage

FIX ANY ISSUES FOUND:
- Missing payment flows
- Broken embed generation
- Incorrect money routing
- Incomplete onboarding
- Missing admin controls

EXPECTED RESULT:
Complete verification that:
1. HVAC companies can sign up and pay me monthly
2. Their customers can pay them through the widget
3. Embed codes work perfectly
4. Money flows to correct accounts
5. System is ready for real customers

Test every critical path and document any issues that need fixing before launch.
